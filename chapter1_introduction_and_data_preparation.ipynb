    "In the following feynman diagram the Higgs boson originates from the interaction of the gluons of the two collided protons. Since the Higgs boson only couples to massive particles the boson can not directly be produced by the massless gluons. Therefore, the Higgs boson is generated via the intermediate step of a top quark loop. The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle and thus provides a very strong coupling to the Higgs boson. Due to its high mass, the Higgs boson decays almost immediately into two Z bosons. Since these Z bosons also have a high mass, they also decay into a lepton-antilepton-pair before they reach the detector.\n",

    "In quantum physics, no concrete process outcomes are predicted, only their probabilities. In order to make a prediction for the measurement at the ATLAS detector, the frequencies must be simulated. For this purpose, random events are generated on the basis of the probability densities and then their respective measurement in the detector is simulated. Generating the expected number of events results in the following distribution for the lepton with the largest transverse momentum. The distribution itself is again split into the different Higgs processes (ggH125_ZZ4lep, VBFH125_ZZ4lep, WH125_ZZ4lep and ZH125_ZZ4lep) and the background processes (llll, Zee, Zmumu and ttbar_lep).\n",

This distribution of the \"raw\" simulation events thus no longer corresponds to what can be expected for the actual measurement. To correct this, event weights are applied. Thus, each simulated event will enter the distribution only as fraction of an event given by the respective event weight. This weight depends on the respective simulated process as well as on the kinematic region of the event. In addition, there are also negative weights to compensate for excess simulated events. The result is comparable to the initial distribution but offers a much smoother prediction.\n",
